# Cricket Performance Analysis 📊

This is a beginner-level Excel data visualization project where I analyzed the performance of top Indian cricket players.

## 📄 About the Project
I created a **Combo Chart** comparing:
- 🟦 Runs (as Bars)
- 🔶 Strike Rate (as Line)

The goal is to visualize which players performed best, using both raw scores and efficiency (strike rate).

## 👨‍💻 Skills Practiced
- Microsoft Excel
- Chart creation (bar + line)
- Basic calculations (formulas)
- Data storytelling

## 📁 File
- `Book.pdf`: Contains the data table and the final chart.

## 🔗 Next Step
This is the first project in my journey to become a remote Data Analyst.
More projects coming soon!
